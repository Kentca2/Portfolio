# Project 4

This was a Project created in my Programming Languages course (Fall 2021). The purpose of this project was to take a test file as input, tokenize the given input, and parse the tokenized input to determine if its grammatically valid. To compile on Mac or Linux machines, use: gcc -std=c99 -o Analyzer.out Givens.c Parser.c Tokenizer.c Analyzer.c
